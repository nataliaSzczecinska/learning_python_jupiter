No minimum age in order to request a voluntary abortion (IVG). A pregnant minor needs the consent of her parents (or her legal representative), or she can keep her abortion secret, in which case she needs to be accompanied by an adult person of her choice.[18] After 14 weeks, an IMG can be carried out for: The continued pregnancy poses a serious danger to the woman; or there is a large probability that the child would be born with serious, incurable disease.[19]";;
Germany;12 Weeks;"Abortion is legal only if the pregnant woman has been advised by a doctor at least three days before performing the abortion (Bedenkzeit, time for consideration). A later, medically indicated abortion is possible in cases of: life of the woman is in danger; the physical or psychological health of the pregnant woman could be seriously endangered by not aborting the pregnancy. In such a case, the otherwise mandatory counseling by a doctor is voluntary.[20] Abortions on request during the first 12 weeks were enacted by East Germany in 1972. West Germany followed suit in 1974, but the Federal Constitutional Court ruled the law unconstitutional because it infringed the right to life of the unborn. A new law in 1976 allowed abortions only when the woman was physically or psychologically in danger; if the child would be born with a severe disability; if carrying out the pregnancy would cause severe social problems for the woman (e.g. poverty) or if the pregnancy was the result of sexual violence. There were no abortions on request. Today's rules, granting the right to non-medical abortions on request, were enacted in 1993.[citation needed]";;
